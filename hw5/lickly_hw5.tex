\problem{In the abstract interpretation example with the factorial from
the lecture, you can see that the analysis was rather imprecise. How can you
improve the result of this analysis by:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Changing the factorial program but not changing the analysis, and
  \item Changing the abstract interpretation setup but without changing the
factorial program.
\end{enumerate}
Give separate solutions for each of the above ways to address the problem.
}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item One way to change the factorial program would be to restructure it so
  that the counter variable counts up rather than down, such as in the
  following program:
  \begin{algorithmic}
  \STATE $y := 1, n := 1$
  \WHILE{$n\ne x$} %{
    \STATE $n := n + 1$
    \STATE $y := y * n$
  \ENDWHILE %}
  \end{algorithmic}
  Since every assignment starts only with positive numbers on its
  right-hand side, it is much easier to prove that the fixed point of $A(y)$
  and $A(n)$ is $+$ at all program points.  In particular, we can proove that
  the value of $y$ at program point 5 must be positive.
  
  \newpage
  \newcommand{\nonneg}{\ge\!\!0}
  \item One way to change the abstract interpretation to get a more precise
  result for $y$ at point 5 would be to change the lattice to the following
  lattice:

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{lattice}
  \end{center}

  In this lattice, $\top$, $+$, and $\bot$ are the same as before, but $\nonneg$
  is such that $\gamma(\nonneg) = \{ x | x \ge 0 \}$. Since that is a superset of
  the positive integers, we must have $\nonneg \  > \  +$.

  As before, we can start with $A(x) = +$, $A(y) = \top$ at point 1 of the flow
  graph.
  
  At point 2 in our first iteration, we will have $A(x) = +$, $A(y) = +$.
  %
  At point 3, knowing that $x\ne 0$ does not help us, so we get the same
  constraints as at point 2 (in this iteration).
  %
  At point 4, the multiplying $+$ by $+$ has left us with $+$, so we still have
  $A(x) = A(y) = +$.
  
  After executing $x := x - 1$, we must increase the set of possible values of
  $x$, moving its abstract value up from $+$ to $\nonneg$.
  Thus in the second iteration, we have that $A(x) = \nonneg$, $A(y) = +$ at
  point 2.
  
  In this iteration, knowing $x\ne0$ does help us.  In particular
  $
  \alpha(\{\sigma | \sigma \in \gamma(\nonneg) \wedge x \ne 0 \}) = +
  $.
  Thus, the abstract values at point 3 remain $A(x) = A(y) = +$.
  
  At point 5, knowing that $x==0$ does not help us in terms of our abstract
  values, since we don't distinguish between $x=0$ and $x \ge 0$.
  Thus we can infer the values of $A(x) = \nonneg$ and $A(y) = +$ at point 5.
  
  At this stage, nothing more can change, so we have reached a fixed point. 
  Thus, we have proven that the output $y$, is positive if the program
  terminates.
\end{enumerate}

\problem{In the lecture we have seen how to define the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$
functions starting from an arbitrary abstraction function $\beta$. Another way to
start is by choosing the function $\gamma$ first. Given $\gamma$, write the
definition of $\alpha$ and prove that $\alpha$ is monotonic and forms a Gallois
connection with $\gamma$. In the process of doing this you will realize that this
does not work with an arbitrary $\gamma$. What are the necessary conditions that
$\gamma$ must satisfy? Hint: My solution for $\alpha$ involves a
greatest-lower-bound operation.
}

Clearly, in order to satisfy the first requirement of a Gallios connection,
$\gamma$ must be monotonic.  It also turns out that the converse is also true. 
Taken together, these require the following restriction of
$\gamma : Abs \to \powerset(C)$
\[
\forall n, m \in Abs, n \le m \iff \gamma(n) \subseteq \gamma(m)
\]

Then we can define $\alpha : \powerset(C) \to Abs$ as follows:
\[
\alpha(S) =  \glb \left\{ a | \gamma(a) \supseteq S \right\}
\]

Claim: This definition of $\alpha$ forms a Gallios connection with $\gamma$.
\begin{proof}
Let $\gamma$ be an arbitrary function satifying our constraints, and $\alpha$
be as in our definition.

Subclaim 1: $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are monotonic
\begin{proof}
$\gamma$ is monotonic trivially by our restriction, so we only need to prove
that $\alpha$ is monotonic.
Given $S_1 \subseteq S_2 \subseteq \powerset(C)$, clearly
$S' \supseteq S_2 \implies S' \supseteq S_1$.
Thus, 
$
\left\{ a | \gamma(a) \supseteq S_2 \right\} \supseteq \left\{ a | \gamma(a)
\supseteq S_1 \right\}.
$
 Thus,
$\gamma(S_2) \supseteq \gamma(S_1)$.
\end{proof}

Subclaim 2: $\alpha(\gamma(a)) = a$ for all $a \in Abs$
\begin{proof}
First, choose an arbitrary $a \in Abs$.
By the definitions of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, we have that
\[
\alpha(\gamma(a)) = \glb \left\{ b | \gamma(b) \supseteq \gamma(a) \right\}
\]
By our restriction on $\gamma$, this is the same as:
\[
\glb \left\{ b | b \ge a \right\}
\]
But since $Abs$ is a lattice, this is the same as $a$.
\end{proof}

Subclaim 3: $\gamma(\alpha(S)) \supseteq S$ for all $S \in \powerset(C)$
\begin{proof}
Let $S$ be an arbitrary subset of $C$.
By our definitions of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, we have
\[
\gamma(\alpha(S)) =  \gamma( \glb \left\{ a | \gamma(a) \supseteq S \right\} )
\]

\problem{
Prove the following statement. For any boolean command $b$ and any initial state
$\sigma$ such that $\sigma(x)$ is even, if $\llbracket \while{b}{x := x + 2}
\rrbracket \sigma = \sigma'$ and if $\sigma = \bot$ then $\sigma'(x)$ is even.
Unlike in previous assignment, this time you should use denotational semantics
for the proof.

\problem{
Recall that we obtained the least fixed point of a monotone
and continuous function $F : D \to D$ by starting with $\bot = F^0(\bot)$ and
repeatedly applying $F$ to the result. Let's explore what happens if we do not
start with $\bot$ but with some other element $x \in D$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is a necessary and sufficient condition for the sequence $F^i(x)$
  to be a chain, that is $x \sqsubseteq F(x) \sqsubseteq F^2 (x) \ldots$ ?

  \item Prove that if the condition above holds then $\bigsqcup_i F^i (x)$ is a
  fixed-point and furthermore it is the least of all fixed-points that are
  $\sqsupseteq$ than $x$.

  \item Find a necessary and sufficient condition for the $\bigsqcup_i F^i (x)$ to be
the overall least-fixed point.
\end{enumerate}

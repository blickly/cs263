\problem{
Prove using Hoare rules the following property: For any boolean
command $b$, if we start the command $\while{b}{x := x + 2}$ in a state in
which $x$ is even, and if the command terminates, it terminates in a state in
which $x$ is even.
}

\problem{Consider the following alternate Hoare rule for $while$:
\[
\frac{\proves \axiomatic{A}{c}{b \implies A \wedge \neg b \implies B}}
{\proves \axiomatic{b \implies A \wedge \neg b \implies B}{\while{b}{c}}{B}}
\]
    Show that the system of axioms remains complete if we replace the old
rule for while with this one. You must show that any derivation that uses
the old rule for while can be written with this rule instead.
}

\problem{Consider the following alternate Hoare rule for $while$:
\[
\frac{\proves \axiomatic{A \wedge b}{c}{A}}
{\proves \axiomatic{A}{\while{b}{c}}{A}}
\]
This rule is not complete. Give a counterexample and a short justification.
}

\problem{Consider now another Hoare rule for $while$:
\[
\frac{\proves \axiomatic{A}{c}{A}}
{\proves \axiomatic{A}{\while{b}{c}}{A \wedge \neg b}}
\]
This rule is also incomplete. Give a counterexample and a short justifi-
cation.
